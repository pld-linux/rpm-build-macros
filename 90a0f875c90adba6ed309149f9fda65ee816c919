- add conflicts on rpm < 4.4.1 because in rpm.macros currently in AC-branch
  will expand in %install _enable_debug_packages, even if it's defined to 0.
  i think it's bug by itself (no way to disable _enable_debug_packages by
  redefining it to 0, other than %undefining it?)

  rpm-4.4.1:
  %install %{?_enable_debug_packages:%{?buildsubdir:%{debug_package}}}\

  rpm-4.3-0.20040107.62:
  %install \
  %if 0%{?_enable_debug_packages}\
  %{?buildsubdir:%{debug_package}}\
  %endif\
